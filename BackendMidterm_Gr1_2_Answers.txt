1. Describe closure in JS:
- A closure is created when a function remembers its lexical scope even when the function is executed outside that scope.
Example: function outer() { let x = 10; return function() { return x; } }

2. What is http-only cookie?
- A cookie that is not accessible via JavaScript (document.cookie).
- Helps prevent XSS attacks. Can only be read by the server.

3. What will the code output and why?
Code:
var item = {
    _fullName: 'George Kartvelishvili',
    getFullName: function (){
       return this._fullName;
    }
};
var f = item.getFullName;
console.log(f());
console.log(item.getFullName());

Answer:
f() is called in global context => this is undefined => undefined
Second is normal call => outputs 'George Kartvelishvili'

4. What will the output be and why?
Code:
(function () {
    try {
        throw new Error();
    } catch (x) {
        var x = 1, y = 2;
        console.log(x);
    }
    console.log(x);
    console.log(y);
})();

Answer:
Inside catch, x is declared with var (not block scoped), y is also var.

First x (inside catch): 1
Second x (outside catch): refers to hoisted var x, but never assigned â†’ undefined
y is 2

Output:
1
undefined
2

5. What will the following code output and why?
Code:
var b = 1;
function outer(){
    var b = 2
    function inner(){
        b++;
        console.log(b)
        var b = 3;
        console.log(b)
    }
    inner();
}
outer();

Answer:
Due to hoisting, inner()'s var b is undefined before increment.
b++ on undefined => NaN
Then b = 3 => prints 3
Output:
NaN
3

6. Write a JavaScript function that returns a string with letters in alphabetical order:
function alphabetOrder(str) {
    return str.split('').sort().join('');
}

7. Write a JavaScript function to sort array of objects by title:
function sortByTitle(arr) {
    return arr.sort((a, b) => a.title.localeCompare(b.title));
}
